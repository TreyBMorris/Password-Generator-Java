# Password-Generator-Java-1.0
 Written as a project for my AP Comp Sci A Course. 
 This Project includes all topics I have learned so far in the course such as 
 - Primitive Data Types
 - Using Objects
 - Boolean Expressions and If Statements
 - Iteration (For and While Loops)
 - Writing Classes and Methods
 This is my edition of this project, as I plan on later re-writing this project to update more information and abilities that I will have learned from the AP Computer Science A course.
